3.Process BigData using HBase.

HBase:
HBase is a column-oriented database that’s an open-source implementation of Google’s Big Table storage architecture. 
It can manage structured and semi-structured data and has some built-in features such as scalability, versioning, compression and garbage collection.

Since its uses write-ahead logging and distributed configuration, it can provide fault-tolerance and quick recovery from individual server failures.
HBase built on top of Hadoop / HDFS and the data stored in HBase can be manipulated using Hadoop’s MapReduce capabilities.

HDFS vs. HBase

HDFS is a distributed file system that is well suited for storing large files. It’s designed to support batch processing of data but doesn’t provide 
  fast individual record lookups. HBase is built on top of HDFS and is designed to provide access to single rows of data in large tables. 

HBase Architecture

The HBase Physical Architecture consists of servers in a Master-Slave relationship. 
  Typically, the HBase cluster has one Master node, called HMaster and multiple Region Servers called 
  HRegionServer. Each Region Server contains multiple Regions – HRegions.

  Just like in a Relational Database, data in HBase is stored in Tables and these Tables are stored in Regions. 
  When a Table becomes too big, the Table is partitioned into multiple Regions. These Regions are assigned to 
  Region Servers across the cluster. Each Region Server hosts roughly the same number of Regions.

The HMaster in the HBase is responsible for

Performing Administration
Managing and Monitoring the Cluster
Assigning Regions to the Region Servers
Controlling the Load Balancing and Failover

On the other hand, the HRegionServer perform the following work

Hosting and managing Regions
Splitting the Regions automatically
Handling the read/write requests
Communicating with the Clients directly

Each Region Server contains a Write-Ahead Log (called HLog) and multiple Regions. Each Region in turn is made up of
  a MemStore and multiple StoreFiles (HFile). The data lives in these StoreFiles in the form of Column Families. 
  The MemStore holds in-memory modifications to the Store (data).

The mapping of Regions to Region Server is kept in a system table called .META. When trying to read or write data 
  from HBase, the clients read the required Region information from the .META table and directly communicate with
  the appropriate Region Server. Each Region is identified by the start key (inclusive) and the end key (exclusive)

HBase Data Model:
The Data Model in HBase is designed to accommodate semi-structured data that could vary in field size, data type and columns. 
  Additionally, the layout of the data model makes it easier to partition the data and distribute it across the cluster. 
The Data Model in HBase is made of different logical components such as Tables, Rows, Column Families, Columns, Cells and Versions.

HBase Installation steps:
Step 1: Prerequisites
    i.Java 8 or higher (OpenJDK or Oracle)
    ii.SSH (if you plan to run in pseudo-distributed mode)
    iii.hadoop installed.

Step 2: Download HBase
Get it from the official Apache website:

🔗 https://hbase.apache.org/downloads.html
vaagdevi:~/hdoop$ wget https://downloads.apache.org/hbase/2.4.17/hbase-2.4.17-bin.tar.gz
vaagdevi:~/hdoop$ tar -xzf hbase-2.4.17-bin.tar.gz
vaagdevi:~/hdoop$ mv hbase-2.4.17 hbase

Step 3: Set Environment Variables

vaagdevi:~/hdoop$ nano ~/.bashrc
export HBASE_HOME=/home/vaagdevi/hdoop/hbase
export PATH=$PATH:$HBASE_HOME/bin

*Once you add the variables, save and exit the .bashrc file. ctrl+s & ctrl+x.
*Run the command below to apply the changes to the current running environment:

vaagdevi:~$ source ~/.bashrc

Step 4: Setting java path for hbase
Now copy java home path by following command
vaagdevi:~/hdoop$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

a. Use the previously created $HBASE_HOME variable to access the hbase-env.sh file:
vaagdevi:~/hdoop/hbase/conf$ nano hbase-env.sh

b. Uncomment the $JAVA_HOME variable and replace the following.
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export HBASE_DISABLE_HADOOP_CLASSPATH_LOOKUP="true"

Step 5:  Configure HBase (Standalone Mode):

Navigate to the HBase configuration directory and edit the configuration files.

vaagdevi:~/hdoop$ cd /hbase/conf

a. Edit hbase-site.xml
Configure the default file system (HBASE):

vaagdevi:~/hdoop/hbase/conf $ nano hbase-site.xml
Add the following configuration inside <configuration>:
//Here you have to set the path where you want HBase to store its files.
  <property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>hdfs://localhost:9000/hbase</value>
  </property>
 //Here you have to set the path where you want HBase to store its built in zookeeper  files.
   <!-- ZooKeeper quorum configuration (list of ZooKeeper servers) -->
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>localhost</value>
  </property>
  <property>
  <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
  <value>2181</value>
</property>
  <!-- The directory where ZooKeeper stores its data -->
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
    <value>/home/vaagdevi/hdoop/hbase/zookeeper</value>
  </property>
<property>
<!-- Write Ahead Log -->
  <name>hbase.wal.provider</name>
  <value>filesystem</value>
</property>
<!-- The directory where HBase stores its data -->
 <property>
    <name>hbase.tmp.dir</name>
    <value>/home/vaagdevi/hdoop/hbase/HFiles</value>
  </property>

*save and exit the hbase-site.xml file. ctrl+s & ctrl+x.
(now create 2 directories with "HFiles" & "zookeeper" to store logs in hbase folder)
///
Note: check this before starting HBase
Disable Hadoop dfs safemode by $ hadoop dfsadmin -safemode leave
put same port numbers of hosts in $ sudo nano /etc/hosts 
///
Step 7: Verify the Installation

vaagdevi:~/hdoop/hbase/bin$ start-hbase.sh
*check logs created in HFiles & zookeeper diectories. 

Check if the Hadoop & Hbase daemons are running:
vaagdevi:~/hdoop/hbase/bin $ jps
You should see the following processes running:
NameNode
DataNode
ResourceManager
NodeManager
HMaster

(wait for 1 min to HBase to start completely and check logs by
vaagdevi:~/hdoop/hbase/logs$ grep -i "Master" hbase-*-master-*.log | tail -n 20)

Step 8: HBase Shell
vaagdevi:~/hdoop/hbase $ ./bin/hbase shell

**to check status of servers
shell> status

**to create a table (create <table name>,<column family> )
shell> create 'emp', 'personal data', 'professional data'

**to verify 
shell> list

**to insert data into table(put <table name>,row1,<colfamily:colname>,<value>)
put 'emp','1','personal data:name','navi'
put 'emp','1','personal data:city','hyderabad'
put 'emp','1','professional data:designation','manager'
put 'emp','1','professional data:salary','50000'

**to show table data
shell> scan 'emp'

Step 8: Access the HBase Web UI
http://localhost:16010
